# 🍉💥 Fruit Ninja Game

## 📝 Description

This is a fun and interactive **Fruit Ninja-style game** developed using **Python and Pygame**. The player slices fruits to earn points while avoiding bombs that can cost lives. It's fast-paced, colorful, and a great way to demonstrate Python skills!

## 🎯 Aim & Purpose

This game was developed to:
- Practice Python concepts, especially the **`random` module** and **mouse event handling**
- Explore basic **game development using Pygame**
- Create a game purely for **entertainment and learning purposes**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Run the game and **press any key** to start.
- Fruits appear randomly on the screen — **slice them using your mouse cursor**.
- **Avoid the bombs!** If you hit one, you’ll **lose a life** 💣.
- You get **3 lives total** ❌❌❌, shown in the top right corner.
- Your **score** is shown in the top left corner.
- Once all lives are lost, a **Game Over** screen will appear.
- You can **restart the game** by pressing any key again.

🎮 **Slicing action**: When you move your cursor over a fruit, it splits into two — just like the real Fruit Ninja game!
